## Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

- The success rate of crowdfunding stands at 73%, with theater emerging as the most popular category across various countries.
- Backers tend to feel more confident in a project's success when the funding goal appears achievable. The dataset indicates that there is a higher percentage of successful campaigns when the goal falls within the range of 1,000 to 9,999 compared to goals higher than this threshold.
- Least run campaigns are for the category music world and audio but has consistently turned to be successful.


## What are some limitations of this dataset?

(-)	Inconsistent comparison: Currency being recorded as of different counties can create discrepancies when comparing the funding amount.
•	Upon examining the dataset, it appears that the collection of campaign duration might not been consistently recorded for all campaigns as some campaigns only ran for couple of days. As a result, we can expect variations in how the lifecycle of campaigns are represented in the data, possibly overlooking certain stages or time periods of the campaigns.


## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

•	Analyzing the relationship between campaign duration and success rate on a graph/ table. Might assist us with determining whether shorter or longer campaigns tend to be more effective, pinpointing the saturation point where extending the campaign might diminish the benefits or having a shorter campaign might lead to missed opportunities.


## Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.

•	Skewed distribution in our data graph and the presence of outliers that can introduce bias, it is advisable to utilize the median as a summary measure.

## Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

•	There is a notable level of variability in the number of backers for both successful and unsuccessful crowdfunding campaigns.
•	 Yes, it makes sense as we can notice that the average number of backers in successful campaigns greatly exceeds the average number of backers in unsuccessful campaigns, indicating a positive correlation between the number of backers and campaign success. Higher the number of backers, more are the chances of the success rate.
